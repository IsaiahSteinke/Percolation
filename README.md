# Percolation
This repository contains some `Fortran` codes that I wrote as part of the work for my Ph.D. dissertation. The codes essentially run classical percolation problems (site, bond, and mixed site/bond) for the square and triangular lattices. These codes were used as part of a model for zinc oxide (ZnO) transistor devices. The codes are a bit overkill for the transistor model but output quite a bit of information that I used to ensure that the percolation behaviors and statistics were correct according to the basic mathematical theories.

The `MATLAB` codes take some of the output to create visualizations of the clusters on the square/triangular lattices. The `SampleOutput` directory contains images of the output of these codes at various stages during the process of adding sites or bonds to the lattice.
